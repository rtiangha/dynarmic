a32_constant_memory_reads_pass:
One possible optimization could be to reduce the number of calls to cb->IsReadOnlyMemory(vaddr) and cb->MemoryReadX(vaddr). 
These function calls could potentially be expensive if they involve system calls or other slow operations.
The cache lookup is performed by calculating the index into the cache array using the low bits of the memory address.

a64_callback_config_pass.cpp:
I’ve added a switch statement to handle different byte sizes in a more efficient manner. This reduces the number of iterations in the while loops, 
which can improve performance.

constant_propagation_pass.cpp:
 In bool FoldCommutative(IR::Inst& inst, bool is_32_bit, ImmFn imm_fn):
 Avoid unnecessary function calls: In the FoldCommutative function, the inst.GetArg(0) and inst.GetArg(1) are called multiple times. You can call them once and store the result in a variable to use later.
 Reduce condition checks: In the FoldCommutative function, the conditions is_lhs_immediate && !is_rhs_immediate and !is_lhs_immediate && is_rhs_immediate are checked separately. You can merge these two conditions to avoid checking them twice.

 In bool FoldShifts(IR::Inst& inst):
 Avoid unnecessary function calls: In the FoldShifts function, the inst.GetArg(1) is called twice to get the shift_amount. You can call it once and store the result in a variable to use later.
 Reduce condition checks: In the FoldShifts function, the condition inst.NumArgs() == 3 && shift_amount.IsImmediate() && !shift_amount.IsZero() is checked after a similar condition inst.NumArgs() == 3 && !carry_inst. 
 You can merge these two conditions to avoid checking inst.NumArgs() == 3 twice.

identity_removal_pass.cpp:
We’re storing the arguments of each instruction in a temporary vector. 
This reduces the number of times we call GetArg and SetArg

polyfill_pass.cpp:
In void PolyfillSHA256MessageSchedule0(IR::IREmitter& ir, IR::Inst& inst):
You’re calling ir.VectorSetElement and ir.VectorGetElement inside a loop. These function calls can be expensive, especially when they’re inside a loop. 
You can avoid these calls by storing the elements in a temporary array.

In void PolyfillSHA256MessageSchedule1(IR::IREmitter& ir, IR::Inst& inst):
We’re storing the results of the VectorRotateRight, VectorEor, and VectorAdd operations in temporary variables. 
This reduces the number of times we call these functions

In void PolyfillPass(IR::Block& block, const PolyfillOptions& polyfill):
We’re storing the opcode in a temporary variable and setting the insertion point only when necessary. 
This reduces the number of times we call GetOpcode and SetInsertionPointBefore

verification_pass.cpp:
Use unordered_map instead of map and reserve space for the unordered_map.
