a32_constant_memory_reads_pass:
One possible optimization could be to reduce the number of calls to cb->IsReadOnlyMemory(vaddr) and cb->MemoryReadX(vaddr). 
These function calls could potentially be expensive if they involve system calls or other slow operations.
We can achieve this by storing the results of these function calls in a cache (a std::unordered_map), and reusing the results for the same vaddr values.
In this modified version, a cache is used to store the results of cb->IsReadOnlyMemory(vaddr) and cb->MemoryRead64(vaddr) for each vaddr. 
When the same vaddr is encountered again, the results are retrieved from the cache instead of calling the functions again.

a64_callback_config_pass.cpp:
I’ve added a switch statement to handle different byte sizes in a more efficient manner. This reduces the number of iterations in the while loops, 
which can improve performance.

constant_propagation_pass.cpp:
 In bool FoldCommutative(IR::Inst& inst, bool is_32_bit, ImmFn imm_fn):
 Avoid unnecessary function calls: In the FoldCommutative function, the inst.GetArg(0) and inst.GetArg(1) are called multiple times. You can call them once and store the result in a variable to use later.
 Reduce condition checks: In the FoldCommutative function, the conditions is_lhs_immediate && !is_rhs_immediate and !is_lhs_immediate && is_rhs_immediate are checked separately. You can merge these two conditions to avoid checking them twice.

 In bool FoldShifts(IR::Inst& inst):
 Avoid unnecessary function calls: In the FoldShifts function, the inst.GetArg(1) is called twice to get the shift_amount. You can call it once and store the result in a variable to use later.
 Reduce condition checks: In the FoldShifts function, the condition inst.NumArgs() == 3 && shift_amount.IsImmediate() && !shift_amount.IsZero() is checked after a similar condition inst.NumArgs() == 3 && !carry_inst. 
 You can merge these two conditions to avoid checking inst.NumArgs() == 3 twice.

dead_code_elimination_pass.cpp:
add a preliminary check to skip the iteration if the block is empty.

identity_removal_pass.cpp:
we’re storing the arguments of each instruction in a temporary vector. 
This reduces the number of times we call GetArg and SetArg
