a32_constant_memory_reads_pass:
One possible optimization could be to reduce the number of calls to cb->IsReadOnlyMemory(vaddr) and cb->MemoryReadX(vaddr). 
These function calls could potentially be expensive if they involve system calls or other slow operations.
We can achieve this by storing the results of these function calls in a cache (a std::unordered_map), and reusing the results for the same vaddr values.
In this modified version, a cache is used to store the results of cb->IsReadOnlyMemory(vaddr) and cb->MemoryRead64(vaddr) for each vaddr. 
When the same vaddr is encountered again, the results are retrieved from the cache instead of calling the functions again.

a64_callback_config_pass.cpp:
Iâ€™ve added a switch statement to handle different byte sizes in a more efficient manner. This reduces the number of iterations in the while loops, 
which can improve performance.

dead_code_elimination_pass.cpp:
add a preliminary check to skip the iteration if the block is empty.
