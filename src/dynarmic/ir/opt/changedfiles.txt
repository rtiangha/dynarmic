a32_constant_memory_reads_pass:
Currently, the function checks if each instructionâ€™s arguments 
are all immediates and if the memory at the virtual address is read-only 
for every opcode case. This check could be moved outside of the switch 
statement to avoid redundancy.

dead_code_elimination_pass.cpp:
add a preliminary check to skip the iteration if the block is empty.
