math_util.cpp:
precalculate the Lookup Tables (LUTs) at compile time using constexpr and std::array

memory_pool.cpp and .h:
std::vector for slabs
remove std::vector<char*> empty_slabs;

spin_lock_arm64.cpp and spin_lock_x64.cpp:
 Iâ€™ve moved the initialization of the SpinLockImpl to its constructor. 
 This means that the spin lock is initialized when the SpinLockImpl object is created, 
 rather than the first time Lock or Unlock is called. 
 This removes the need for std::call_once and the flag variable
