math_util.cpp:
precalculate the Lookup Tables (LUTs) at compile time using constexpr and std::array

memory_pool.cpp and .h:
std::vector for slabs
remove std::vector<char*> empty_slabs;

spin_lock_arm64.cpp and spin_lock_x64.cpp:
 I’ve moved the initialization of the SpinLockImpl to its constructor. 
 This means that the spin lock is initialized when the SpinLockImpl object is created, 
 rather than the first time Lock or Unlock is called. 
 This removes the need for std::call_once and the flag variable

x64_disassemble.cpp:
 I’ve moved the initialization of the ZydisDecoder and ZydisFormatter to 
 a separate Initialize function. You should call this function once before 
 calling DumpDisassembledX64 or DisassembleX64. 
 I’ve also added a call to std::vector::reserve in DisassembleX64.
